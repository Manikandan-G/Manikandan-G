- 👋 Hi, I’m Manikandan Ganesan — Software & Research Engineer with 6+ years across hardware & software. I’m currently building AI-powered software products using large language models, including RAG-based apps and full-stack AI tools.
- ⚙️ On the side, I tinker with hardware Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP8266 and love exploring new programming languages and emerging tech.
- 💡 I started as an Embedded Engineer and now build cool AI projects like generative animation tools, predictive models, and chatbots empowered with RAG.
- 🔧 Tech stack: Python, C/C++, JavaScript, plus frameworks like React, Flask. I’ve implemented OCPP and MQTT protocols, and even wrapped up a degree in Cybersecurity.
- 🔐 I’m passionate about problem-solving and building secure, scalable solutions.
